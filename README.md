# Cancer-Data-Classification-using-KNN
The main task is to build a predictive model using the Cancer dataset from Kaggle to accurately classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
This dataset contains the characteristics of patients diagnosed with cancer. 
The dataset contains a unique ID for each patient, the type of cancer (diagnosis), the visual characteristics of the cancer and the average values of these characteristics.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifies new cancer example based on the majority class of its k closest neighbors.
